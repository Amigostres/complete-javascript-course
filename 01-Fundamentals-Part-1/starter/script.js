//==================================================
//12 let, const, and var

//perfectly to "REASSIGNING" a variable with a let
let age = 30;
age = 31;

//the value of const cannot be changed
const birthYear = 1991;
//birthYear = 1990; // this will cause an error
//when using const you need to assign something to it
// const job;//this will cause an error

//var at first sight will pretty much work the same as let

var job = "programmer";
job = "teacher"; // var has no problem redeclaring
console.log(job);
