//12 let, const, and var

//perfectly to "REASSIGNING" a variable with a let
let age = 30;
age = 31;

//the value of const cannot be changed
const birthYear = 1991;
//birthYear = 1990; // this will cause an error
//when using const you need to assign something to it
// const job;//this will cause an error

//var at first sight will pretty much work the same as let

var job = "programmer";

//Type conversion and coercion
// you can convert strings into a number with type conversion

const inputYear = "1991"; // we have to convert this string into a number so that it can add instead of concat when adding with a number datatype
console.log(Number(inputYear), inputYear); // Number function will convert other datatypes into a Number

//type Coercion
let n = "1" + 1; //this will be '11' because it will concat the string ' 1 ' with number 1 converting 1 into '1' and contats
n = n - 1; //now that we have '11' then we will have to subtract it by one and
// since there is no subtraction in strings for any reasons then it will have to turn the string into a number
console.log(n); // outputs 10

//falsy values
//falsy values are values that are natually false when datatype is switch into a boolean datatype
console.log("these are falsy values");

console.log(Boolean({})); // this is true

const money = 0;

if (money) {

//Switch statements

const day = "Monday";
